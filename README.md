# Robocorp Certification Pt.2

## Quick Notes
1. `/devdata/env.json` and `vault.json` were intentionally committed due to this being a "certificate" challenge rather than an actual Robot.
2. Make sure to update `/devdata/env.json` to match your directory where this repo is cloned
3. When all receipts are printed, they will be expored to `/files` folder
